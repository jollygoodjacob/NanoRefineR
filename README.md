# NanoRefineR: A Shiny app for postprocessing and visualizing noisy Nano-Hyperspec HSI data cubes

NanoRefineR is a samll project I developed to allow me to apply certain postprocessing techniques to noisy Headwall Nano-Hyperspec HSI cubes and visualize the spectral differences in real time. 

NanoRefineR provides two main functionalities:
- a post-processing component that allows for spatial downsampling, spectral binning, and Savitzky-Golay smoothing of input datasets
- a visualizer with control over band combinations and the ability to click on areas of an image and see the spectra.
